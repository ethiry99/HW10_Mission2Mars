# HW10_Mission2Mars

My code for scraping work in jupyter notebook and my scraping.py files runs and scrapes the locations as it is meant to.  

My app.py is now running properly in conjunction with the scraping.py file.

Once the flask app is called by app.py the website with additional Bootstrap components are visible.  The button to begin scraping spans the width of the jumbotron, it has a new color and the background color of the body has been changed to a custom color. The page also is capable of being autoformatted to display on mobile.

By clicking the "Scrape New Data" button the process begins and scraping.py begins gathering the lastest Mars news (headline and summary paragraph), a featured Mars image, a table of Mars facts and full-resolution pictures of the 4 Mars hemispheres with their names.
