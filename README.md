My code for scraping work in jupyter notebook and my scraping.py files runs and scrapes the locations it is meant to.  My app.py is not running properly in conjunction with the scraping.py file.

I currently have mixed results with all the data being written to mongo since that occurs in the app.py

I was able to change some components in the index.html file such as added "muted text" a color change of the text.
